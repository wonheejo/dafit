    "# their personal information to be used some place else, that information was not included and came out as 'Nan' as seen in the above. \n",

    "# assumption or analysis about how much time they have actually spent on looking at the products before buying. \n",
    "# For people who have spent just one minute on purchasing 1 product is enough explanation for me and it can be easily understood. \n",
    "# There are also people who have spent alot of time on purchasing between the first and last and it is clear that those people have used this e-commerce to \n",
    "# regularly buy products. \n",
    "# It would have been better if it showed instead the time in minutes or hours looking at the product online before purchasing with the date rather than\n",
    "# having the first and last purchases. And to distinguish those who are regular purchasers, to show the total amount of time shown in hours rather than the current\n",
    "# way of showing. With data like this it would be easier to analyze buyers based on the time spent with how many products and the total cost spent on purchase\n",
